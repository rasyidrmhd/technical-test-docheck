I have done all the questions and I have put them in each folder backend and frontend.

the question that I deploy is only question number 3, i already put the readme file for step-by-step run in local if you needed and deployed url is there too. but I'm also going to put the link down here too:

1. frontend:<br/>
   [Simple todo list app](https://simple-todo-list-app-lime.vercel.app/)
2. backend:<br/>
   [Simple todo list api](https://simple-todo-list-api.vercel.app)</br>
   [Documentation](https://simple-todo-list-api.vercel.app/documentation)
